# Welcome to the Baccarelli Lab
We use state-of-the-art technologies to identify novel disease mechanisms or molecular records of past environmental exposures and life experiences. Within the Mailman School of Public Health at Columbia University, Dr. Baccarelli and the lab are pursuing several areas of active research investigating relationships between environmental exposures and health effects. We in the Lab of Precision Enviornmental Health have a number of active projects in the lab, including investigatations linking the environment, epigenetics and cardiovascular disease risk. Our studies also include mitochondriomics and molecular investigations of respiratory disease and cognitive aging. 

## Our GitHub
In this set of repositories, we work to identify novel disease exposures using a wide variety of statistical methods.
